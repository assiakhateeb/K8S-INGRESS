## Dataloop SDK Task
In this task, we will learn how to use Dataloop's Python SDK.

Let’s say you wish to label and classify your images, add a key points on an image with an assigned label “key”, select only images with assigned label "class1" and reteive all points from your images.
### Before you begin
* Python needs to be installed on your system using this [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The SDK supports python version 3.5.4 at least.
* To do this tutorial you must download an environment that supports python.
In this tutorial, I used [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows).
* [Installation & Login](https://dataloop.ai/docs/sdk-register)

### Running The Application Locally
